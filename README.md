### Project title
#define var "Game", or DVG
### What and why?
Multiplayer games are one of the most popular ways for people to have fun with each other. Currently, however, there aren't any good ways for people to share multiplayer games they've made with each other online. DVG is a platform designed to facilitate creating multiplayer games and playing with your friends online. Using DVG you can upload games made using a simplified library or try games created by other users, as well as create private rooms to play games with friends.

### For whom?
Many DVG users will be people interested in learning about coding or game design. It is the goal of this project to create an intuitive yet unrestrictive way to build multiplayer games, allowing these users to experiment and create. Other DVG users may be looking for entertainment, either with a random lobby or with friends. These users will be able to play games that others have built, optionally in a premade lobby with their friends.

### How?
There are three main components to this project: building games, finding new ones, and playing them with other users. To build games, users should be able to interact with an editor that gives them access to all of the tools necessary to build their project, and run it to test that it does what they actually want.

To find new games, users will be able to browse new, popular or highly rated games. In addition, users should be able to rate games so other users will be able to find the most well-made projects.

When playing games, users should have the option to either join a random lobby or create a new private lobby. Afterwards, the project should run according to the creator of the project's specifications.

### Scope
There are several key non-trivial elements to making this project work as described. For backend, we need to be able to run user-submitted "code" securely and efficiently, and need to be able to communicate with several users simultaneously. For front-end, we need the necessary graphical and input support to make sure users can actually interact with these games. However, as long as these are completed, the project can be scaled up or down as needed. The scope could be expanded to include debugging tools, tagging support to find games easier, or trophies for certain games for users if time permits. If need be, we can instead work on providing a focused editor/player, allowing users to play games without excessive additional attributes.
